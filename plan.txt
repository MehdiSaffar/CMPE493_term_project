# 1. Preprocessing

1. Parsing
2. Tokenization
   1. use nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize
   2. add pos tag
3. Normalization
   1. lemmatize the word with its pos tag
4. Index construction
   1. A simple inverted index is not enough. Need positional index at least.

# 2. Query

1. Tokenization (?)

3. Index lookup
4. Evaluate

# Questions

- where is backtick?!
- some weird chars (\u....) are in inverted index
- seems like some punctuation tokens are slipping to inv. index
- why is inv. index small (only 16mb)?
- maybe there is extra information other than metadata.csv
